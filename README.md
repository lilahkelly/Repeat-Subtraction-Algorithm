# Repeat-Subtraction-Algorithm
This project creates a divider application using VHDL and a repeat subtraction algorithm. The design was created with HLSM and datapaths. A pdf of the final report is included as well. It demonstrates proficiency in VHDL, digital design, HLSM, and algorithms. A public EDA playground link is below for easier access of code.
